# Player_Comparison
This tool allows users to compare the stats of different soccer players. The code has been written entirely in Python, and uses the Beautiful Soup package to srape data from a soccer website. After the collection of relevant stats, extensive data processing is done using pandas and numpy before creating a dashboard using the Matplotlib package. The dashboard contains a scatterplot of Goals per Match vs. Expected Goals per Match, and a soccer field visualization depicting all the shots taken by the players. The soccer field visualization provides information about where the shots were taken, the quality of the chances, and their respective outcomes (i.e. goal or no goal).


This tool uses the libraries mentioned below:
1. BeautifulSoup
2. Matplotlib
3. requests
4. json
5. pandas
6. numpy
7. mplsoccer
8. highlighttext
